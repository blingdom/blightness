# TOMATO BLIGHT DETECTION - MACHINE LEARNING

## Background

The objective of this exercise is to create a machine learning (ML) module that uses computer vision to determine the `healthness` of a `tomamto leaf`. The disease under investigation is `tomato blight`. The technology used is `Python` and related libraries. See `requirements.txt`

## Requirements
A good PC/Laptop with GPU recommended
Any Operating System capable of running Python3 - Linux (Ubuntu) is recommended

**_installation of python in your OS is out of scope, but simple Google search should help_**

## Running
The following assumes you are running on Ubuntu 20.04 or above

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-virtualenv
```

```bash
python3 -m venv .tomato
```

```bash
source .tomato/bin/activate
```

```bash
deactivate
```

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
python blightests.py
```

```python
python guiglight.py
```
